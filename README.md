# R-Learning

This repository is intended to store all R scripts that I have created, as part of my learning journey to conquer R. 

As part of the learning process, the data used may come from multiple sources and communities. All references and data source used for the creation of the charts will be written in the header of each script. Please reference to the respective scripts for more information.
